# Google Calendar Automation

This repository contains a Python-based application for automating Google Calendar tasks such as adding events and scheduling reminders. The application integrates with the OpenAI API to enable natural language commands for seamless interaction.

## Features

- Add events to Google Calendar
- Schedule reminders
- Use natural language commands via OpenAI API

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Calendar API credentials
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/google-calendar-automation.git
   cd google-calendar-automation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your Google Calendar API credentials and save the `credentials.json` file in the root directory of the repository.

5. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Interact with the AI agent using natural language commands. For example:
   - "Add a meeting with John on Monday at 10 AM"
   - "Set a reminder to call Sarah tomorrow at 3 PM"
